# Travel_Aid
This is a react application that uses the google map API to aid users in their travel.
It especially comes in handy when you need to make use of a hotel, restaurant or an attraction site in a new city or town you moved to. Instead of asking around for information, you can easily use this website to instantly get these information yourself. This app says NO! to being stranded in a new location.
